Hello! ðŸ‘‹
I'm Stefan, a computer science student at SGS Berkeley Green UTC with a passion for diversity in coding tasks. I love breaking the monotony of routine work and exploring different aspects of coding. I am proficient in Python, HTML, and CSS, and I have a keen interest in machine learning.

ðŸ“š Key Projects
Book Recommendation Program
This program uses a user's liked books to find recommendations from similar users. It's written in Python and utilizes the concept of user-based collaborative filtering.

Subway Surfers AI
Currently, I'm working on a project involving a deep q-network and screenshot software to create an AI that can play Subway Surfers. 

ðŸŒ± Interests
I have a wide array of hobbies that keep me occupied in my downtime. I love to travel and aspire to have a flexible, remote job that allows me to work from anywhere in the world. When I'm not coding or studying, you can find me cycling, enjoying a nature walk, reading a captivating book, or planning my next adventure.
